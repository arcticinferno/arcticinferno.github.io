I am excited to announce the development of a new build system called "Ark." Written in Haskell, Ark is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to use. 
As a side project, I am hoping to be able to continue maintaining it for a while, but between school and my other projects, it might be a bit spaced out.
